The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The purpose of this project is to explore data visualization techniques utilizing the Iris dataset.This project seeks to reproduce, and to visually modify the given code.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The columns in this dataset are:

    SepalLengthCm
    SepalWidthCm
    PetalLengthCm
    PetalWidthCm
    Species


The class variale is "Species". It has 3 number of classes.

Classes are below:

	Iris-setosa
	Iris-versicolor
	Iris-virginica

These 3 classes depends upon 4 features.
